# Nurikabe-Gui-Solver
Nurikabe Puzzle solver with GUI
This project uses back tracking to solve 'Nurikabe'(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurikabe_(puzzle)).
The idea is there are cells with numbers,and we need to build islands of cells of that number.Rest will be be covered with water.
It is an NP-Complete problem.
Please refer to this paper for more useful information on that(http://cage.ugent.be/~klein/papers/nurikabe.pdf).
Here I have tried to impelement puzzle solvers for size of 10*10,12*12,20*20.The performance for such numbers is very good.
The algorithm is back-tracking with pruning,based on some rules like noted here,

Please go through the screen shots to get an idea about the application.
